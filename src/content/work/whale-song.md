### Whale Song Game Synopsis
> The evil Space Squid Sorcerers have sealed the portals that could bring the baby whale home. Help the whale sing the songs of his people to break through the dark squid magic and reunite him with his family!

We made a musical, timing based (think Guitar Hero) game for the GMTK game jam 2024. I was the project lead and head programmer for a team of four. It was our first time making a game together, so we were happy to put out a working title before the deadline for submissions closed!
